# BusinessRevision
- Had a non chronological Business book that was 300+ pages long
had to write notes on all of it. This program makes separate word documents in segmented intervals.
- For example, a 737 page book that you want to write notes on.
- Each new file generated could consist of X pages, but in this case I shall say 50.
- 15 new files will be generated 0-50, 50-100 ..... 650-700, 700-737
- Took me around 20 minutes to write and test
